# JavaScript One Project Everyday Challenge – From Easiest to Hardest

This repository is part of a personal learning challenge.

My goal is to build **small JavaScript projects**, starting from the **easiest** and gradually moving toward **more complex** ones, focusing on *understanding*, not copying.

---

## Learning Approach

For each project, I follow this process:

1. Find a small project or demo
2. **Do NOT copy the code**
3. Build the project **entirely on my own**
4. Compare my implementation
5. Analyze differences in:
   - Logic
   - Structure
   - Best practices
6. Refactor or improve my version if needed

The goal is to learn **how to think**, not how to follow steps.

---

## Why This Method?

- Avoid tutorial hell
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Learn modern JavaScript patterns naturally
- Build confidence writing code without guidance
- Create projects that actually reflect my understanding

---

## Current Project

### 1. Counter App (Beginner)

A simple counter application that allows users to:
- Increase the count
- Decrease the count
- Reset the count to zero

**Concepts practiced:**
- DOM selection
- Event handling
- State management
- Updating UI from state
- Clean separation of JS logic

This is the **starting point** of the series.

---

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

---

## Note

This repository is meant to document **challenge progress**, not just finished products.
Code clarity and reasoning matter more than perfection.
Projects will be added incrementally as the challenge progresses.
